                            <p>I've been feeling like it's impossible to say it all<br>
                                And I'm losing all control<br>
                                'Cause I wish that I could break the fall and save it all<br>

                                Words don't come that easy<br>

                                Searching for another way<br>
                                Another way, another way<br>
                                To keep her safe another day<br>
                                Another day, another day<br>
                                It's easier to runaway<br>
                                Runaway, runaway<br>
                                Than to know what to say<br>

                                I could watch a show<br>
                                I could go for a walk, but I probably won't<br>
                                I can do anything I put my mind to<br>
                                If I tried to, but I (Oh)<br><br>
    
                                Just watching the clock from the sofa (Oh, oh)<br>

                                Break a promise, so I can leave<br>
                                Burn a forest, so I can sleep<br>
                                Lay my headstone, let the grass grow over me<br><br>
    
                                There's nothing to fill this void<br>
                                Start turning this sorrows<br>
